# Firefox Front Page Clone (HTML/CSS Practice)

A simple, static recreation of the Firefox homepage built with vanilla HTML and CSS. This project is for practicing layout techniques, spacing, typography, and component styling — no JavaScript or frameworks required.

### [Demo](https://ansari-in.github.io/firefox-clone-css-practice/)

## What’s Inside
- **Static clone:** Focused on structure and styling of a modern landing page.
- **Clean HTML/CSS:** Semantic HTML5 and organized CSS for maintainability.
- **Modern layout:** Uses CSS Flexbox and/or Grid for layout sections.
- **Reusable components:** Nav bar, hero section, call-to-action, content cards, and footer.

## Quick Start (Windows)
- Double-click `index.html` to open in your default browser, or run:

```powershell
Start-Process .\index.html
```

- Optional (VS Code Live Server): Install the “Live Server” extension, then right‑click `index.html` → “Open with Live Server”.
- Optional (Python, if installed):

```powershell
py -m http.server 5500; Start-Process http://localhost:5500/
```

## Screenshots
Add your screenshots to the `img/` folder and reference them below. Example filenames:

img/screenshot-desktop.png
img/screenshot-mobile.png
```

```markdown
![Firefox Clone – Desktop](img/screenshot-desktop.png)
![Firefox Clone – Mobile](img/screenshot-mobile.png)
```

Tip: In Windows, use `Win + Shift + S` to capture screenshots and save them to the project’s `img/` folder.

## Customize / Practice Ideas
- **Colors & typography:** Tweak the palette and fonts in `css/style.css` to explore different looks.
- **Spacing system:** Introduce consistent spacing variables (e.g., `--space-1`, `--space-2`) and apply them.
- **Layout variants:** Try switching sections between Flexbox and Grid to compare.
- **Responsive pass:** Add media queries for tablet and mobile breakpoints.
- **Accessibility:** Check headings order, link focus styles, and color contrast.
